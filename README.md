# pro-tour

PR-triggered app walkthroughs: record the main app journeys and a focused tour of the changes in a pull request.

The imported skills are preserved in [`skills-main/`](skills-main/).

The updated Easy Loop workflow is installed at [`.agents/skills/df-easy-loop-e2e/`](.agents/skills/df-easy-loop-e2e/). Its repo-level model assignments are in [`.diffusion/skills/models.yaml`](.diffusion/skills/models.yaml): Codex Astra xhigh writes the plan and code; Cursor Grok 4.7 xhigh critiques, validates, and reviews. Override those role assignments on experiment branches to compare combinations.
